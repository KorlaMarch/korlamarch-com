  Hi, welcome to my little place in the internet :). My name is Khemarat Boonyapaluk. The name is rather long, so I usually go by March, or KorlaMarch in online accounts. I am a student studying in Computer Science Sc.B. and Engineering A.B. at Brown University. My interests lie in robotics, computer system and low-level software/hardware design.
