  Hi, welcome to my little place in the internet :). My name is Khemarat Boonyapaluk. The name is rather long, so I usually go by March, or KorlaMarch in online accounts. I am a sophomore student studying in Computer Science Sc.B. and Engineering A.B. at Brown University. My interests lie in robotics, low-level software/hardware, and electronics. I have been programming since 12 years old, and will continue to do so.
